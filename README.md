**Boids** is a simple simulation project dedicated to showcasing the flocking algorithm (known as *Boids*) in fun and accessible format, complete with sliders, buttons and dropdowns to allow maximum customization.

To download a release, check the [Releases](https://github.com/Xevion/Boids/releases) section and download the appropriate build. **Boids** is built on the Unity Engine, and thus should be fully compatible across a myriad of platforms (although I do not provide Android builds).

*Note: Boids is extremely early in it's development and only has a fraction of the features I want it to have. Current releases are most definitely not even close to what I want Boids to look like. Additionally, I'm very inexperienced with Unity, and even worse with providing Builds to users. If a Build doesn't function, you'll have better luck loading the project and building yourself, likely.*
